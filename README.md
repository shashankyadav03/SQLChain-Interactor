# SQLChain Interactor

## Overview
SQLChain Interactor is a Python-based project that demonstrates an innovative approach to interacting with a PostgreSQL database using the LangChain framework. This project showcases the execution of SQL queries through a user-friendly interface, dynamic query generation, and data visualization, highlighting the power and flexibility of combining advanced frameworks with traditional database management.

## Features
- **Interactive SQL Query Execution:** Execute basic and advanced SQL queries through a user-friendly interface.
- **LangChain Integration:** Leverage the LangChain framework to enhance SQL query execution.
- **Dynamic Query Generation:** Create and execute dynamic SQL queries based on user input.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize query results with graphical representations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Security Measures:** Implement best practices for database security and query execution.

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SQLChain-Interactor.git
   cd SQLChain-Interactor
   ```

2. **Set Up the Python Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install and Configure PostgreSQL:**
   - Download and install PostgreSQL from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
   - Create a new database and user for the project.

5. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your PostgreSQL credentials:
     ```
     DB_NAME=your_db_name
     DB_USER=your_db_user
     DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
     DB_HOST=your_db_host
     DB_PORT=your_db_port
     ```

6. **Run Database Schema and Insert Sample Data:**
   ```bash
   python setup_database.py
   ```

## Database Schema and Sample Data
- The database schema includes tables for users, products, orders, and other entities relevant to the project.
- Sample data is inserted to demonstrate the functionality of the project.

## Usage

### Basic SQL Queries
- Execute basic SQL operations like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE using provided Python scripts.
- Example:
  ```python
  from sqlchain_interactor import execute_query

  query = "SELECT * FROM users;"
  result = execute_query(query)
  print(result)
  ```

### Advanced SQL Operations
- Perform complex queries involving JOINs, subqueries, and aggregate functions.
- Example:
  ```python
  query = """
  SELECT users.name, COUNT(orders.id) as order_count
  FROM users
  JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id
  GROUP BY users.name;
  """
  result = execute_query(query)
  print(result)
  ```

### Interactive Query Interface
- Use the provided command-line interface (CLI) or web-based interface to execute SQL queries interactively.
- Example CLI usage:
  ```bash
  python interactive_cli.py
  ```

### Dynamic Query Generation
- Generate and execute dynamic SQL queries based on user input or predefined criteria.
- Example:
  ```python
  from sqlchain_interactor import generate_dynamic_query

  user_input = {'table': 'products', 'conditions': {'price': '>= 100'}}
  query = generate_dynamic_query(user_input)
  result = execute_query(query)
  print(result)
  ```

### Data Visualization
- Visualize query results with charts and graphs.
- Example:
  ```python
  from sqlchain_interactor import visualize_data

  query = "SELECT category, COUNT(*) as count FROM products GROUP BY category;"
  result = execute_query(query)
  visualize_data(result)
  ```

## Security and Best Practices
- Implement SQL injection prevention techniques.
- Follow best practices for database management and query execution.
- Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.

## Documentation
- Comprehensive documentation is available in the `docs` directory, including setup instructions, code explanations, and usage guidelines.
- A user guide is provided to help users understand and navigate the project.
